# multi-service-hub
An extensible multi-tenant platform that centralizes various B2C services, each with unique or shared business logic. Features include a unified management UI, secure authentication, payment processing, and robust cloud deployment on Azure. Designed for scalability and future integration with mobile applications.

### 1. Tenants
This folder contains code and configurations specific to individual tenants or clients. For example, there are separate subdirectories for the "unscreen" and "text-to-speech" tenants, each containing web interfaces, processing services, and other custom functionalities.

### 2. Shared
The shared directory holds common code and resources that are reused across multiple tenants. This includes shared API code, Angular components, utilities, and helpers.

### 3. Management UI
This is the centralized management user interface, including dashboard components, payment management, user management, and monitoring features. It's likely a web-based interface for managing various aspects of the system.

### 4. Services
This folder hosts backend services written in ASP.NET Core, including authentication, payment processing, file storage integration, and job queue management.

### 5. Database
This directory contains database scripts and migration files for managing a Postgres database.

### 6. Infrastructure
Here, you'll find code related to infrastructure management, such as Docker configurations, Kubernetes manifests, and Terraform scripts for provisioning and managing cloud resources.

### 7. Monitoring
This part contains configuration files for monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to keep track of the system's health and performance.

### 8. Tests
This is where various types of testing scripts are stored, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

### 9. Scripts
The scripts directory contains build, deployment, and utility scripts to automate common tasks.

### 10. Docs
This folder holds the project's documentation, likely including user guides, API references, and architectural diagrams.

### 11. GitHub Actions
This section contains the configuration for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions.

### 12. Project Files
The root directory also includes files like `package.json` for managing JavaScript dependencies and Directory Build Props and Solution file for ASP.NET Core solution/project/build configuration.


### 1. **Multi-Tenant Architecture**
   - **Multiple B2C Websites (Tenants)**: Each tenant represents a unique service (e.g., video background removal, text-to-speech conversion) with its own business logic and web interface.
   - **Centralized Management UI**: A unified management interface to handle payments, users, feedback, monitoring, etc., across all tenants.

### 2. **Frontend Development**
   - **Technologies**: Angular and Tailwind CSS.
   - **Responsibilities**: Building dynamic and responsive web interfaces for each tenant and the centralized management UI.

### 3. **Backend Development**
   - **Technologies**: ASP.NET Core.
   - **Responsibilities**: Developing shared APIs, authentication, payment processing, file storage, job queue, and custom-built scalable video/audio processing services.

### 4. **Database Management**
   - **Technology**: PostgreSQL.
   - **Responsibilities**: Storing user information, transaction history, file metadata, etc.

### 5. **File Storage and Processing**
   - **Custom-Built Scalable Video Processing Service**: For transforming videos using AI, implemented in suitable languages like C++, Python, Rust, or C#.
   - **Azure Blob Storage**: For storing large files.

### 6. **Mobile App Development (Future Scope)**
   - **Technology**: Flutter.
   - **Responsibilities**: Building iOS and Android apps with similar functionalities to the web interfaces.

### 7. **DevOps & CI/CD**
